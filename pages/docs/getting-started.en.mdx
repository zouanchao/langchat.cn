# Local Project Setup

Before starting the project, you need to have the **development environment** ready. Here, we demonstrate how to locally start the project using the latest version of IDEA.

### Clone & Open

First, download the entire project code to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tycoding/langchat.git
```

Open the langchat project folder in IDEA:

<PhotoProvider>
  <div className='flex justify-center my-4'>
    <PhotoView src="/page/open-langchat.png">
      <img src="/page/open-langchat.png" alt="" width='500' />
    </PhotoView>
  </div>
</PhotoProvider>

### Download Dependencies

**Front-end**

The front-end primarily includes langchat-ui and langchat-ui-client modules, which require dependency installation using pnpm:

```bash copy
cd langchat-ui
pnpm install

cd langchat-ui-client
pnpm install
```

**Back-end**

After opening the project in IDEA, it will automatically load Maven dependencies. Apart from the above-mentioned ui modules, the rest are back-end components.
Environment Configuration

Once the code is cloned, you need to modify the configuration files of the back-end SpringBoot project to run it.

**Import SQL***

You need to create a database named langchat under MySQL8, then find the langchat.sql script in the project root directory and import the table structure.

<PhotoProvider>
  <div className='flex justify-center my-4'>
    <PhotoView src="/page/mysql.png">
      <img src="/page/mysql.png" alt="" width='700' />
    </PhotoView>
  </div>
</PhotoProvider>

**Modify application.yml**

Note that application.yml is configured for the local environment by default. You can create a application-local.yml file locally, or modify it for the dev environment using application-dev.yml.

<PhotoProvider>
  <div className='flex justify-center my-4'>
    <PhotoView src="/page/project.png">
      <img src="/page/project.png" alt="" width='700' />
    </PhotoView>
  </div>
</PhotoProvider>

application-dev.yml contains the most basic environment configuration requirements:

1. To start the project, you must configure mysql and redis information properly.
2. langchat.auth defines the super administrator login information for the back-end management system, with is-demo-dev indicating whether to enable the demo environment.
3. langchat.vectorstore defines the information for the LLM vector store, currently using the milvus vector store, though it may change to PgVector or another in the future.
4. langchat.web-search.google defines the key information for Google search functionality, which can be configured as needed.

Note: The LLM configurations may change in the future, and I will specifically introduce the environment configuration parameters of langchat in a new chapter.
Additionally, because the configuration of the LLM large model is dynamically set on the front-end, it does not need to be defined in the configuration file. However, considering that the vector store generally cannot be easily changed, the vectorStore configuration remains in the configuration file.

### Starting the Project

Start the front-end modules using pnpm run dev (or start using IDEA). For the back-end, run the main function of LangChatApp.java:

<PhotoProvider>
  <div className='flex justify-center my-4'>
    <PhotoView src="/page/run.png">
      <img src="/page/run.png" alt="" width='500' />
    </PhotoView>
  </div>
</PhotoProvider>

After starting, visit http://localhost:3003/ to go to the back-end system login page.

<PhotoProvider>
  <div className='flex justify-center my-4'>
    <PhotoView src="/page/langchat-ui.png">
      <img src="/page/langchat-ui.png" alt="" width='700' />
    </PhotoView>
  </div>
</PhotoProvider>
