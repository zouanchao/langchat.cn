# Environment Setup

Before running the project, ensure that the development environment is properly configured. Below are the basic version requirements:

### Front-end

- Node.js > 18

It is recommended to use `pnpm install` instead of `npm` or `yarn`. If you are a user in China and encounter download speed issues, it is recommended to use the following mirror sources:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    # Set to domestic mirror
    npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
    # Set to official mirror
    npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    # Set to domestic mirror
    yarn config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
    # Set to official mirror
    yarn config set registry https://registry.yarnpkg.com
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    # Set to domestic mirror
    pnpm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
    # Set to official mirror
    pnpm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Back-end

The basic environment requirements for the back-end are:

- JDK ≥ 17
- MySQL ≥ 8
- Redis

Considering the project uses the latest technology stack for both front-end and back-end, support for JDK8 is no longer considered (though migrating to JDK8 is straightforward and does not require high costs).

The main reasons for using JDK17 instead of JDK8 are:

1. Development is done with the latest technology stack, including both front-end and back-end. The old version is no longer supported by the official providers.
2. There are many Prompt contents in the LLM project code, and JDK17's """ text block syntax is very convenient.
3. Security and performance reasons.

Beyond these, there are not many changes at the code level. If you want to migrate the code to JDK8, simply consider the above two aspects.
